#### Personal Background

I am Micah Probst, a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, aiming to apply my education to the field of responsible AI. At 19, I graduated with a strong drive that carried me through high school and college at an accelerated pace, along with earning numerous business certificates during my time in community college.

#### Current Focus

As a recent graduate, I'm looking to break into the responsible AI field. I am passionate about human welfare and a supporter of the effective altruism movement. My greatest interest lies in considering what is best for people, communities, and societies—which is why I formally studied philosophy. Given the current global political and technological landscape, AI safety and its impacts on society represent my strongest points of interest, where I want to make a meaningful difference.

#### Career Goals

I would like to become a thought leader in ethical AI development and AI's impacts on society. My work focuses on bridging philosophical frameworks with practical AI development, examining how we can develop AI systems that align with human values and dignity.

#### Interests & Hobbies

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy rock climbing and martial arts, which help me maintain balance and perspective in my approach to complex philosophical and technological challenges.
