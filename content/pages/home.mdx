#### Personal Background

I am German / American currently residing in Boulder, CO but grew up in the Bay Area, Germany and Singapore.
I was fortunate to have had a very international upbringing that has taught me to be adaptable, culturally aware and a good communicator.

My dad helped me build my first website when I was 8 and I never looked back. Soon I was making video games in middle school and building my first
real applications in High School. Problem solving and building things that real people interact with have always been my passionâ€”especially when combined with entrepreneurship.

#### Professional Background

My professional background so far has been shaped by startups. As a result, I am no stranger to shifting deadlines and ever-changing requirements; I adapt and get it done.
I can make impactful decisions, work collaboratively with others and take responsibility for the code I write.
I thoroughly enjoy making an impact and seeing the end user interact with what we build.

#### Career Goals

My preliminary career goal is to find an internship for the summer of 2024.
Either frontend or backend for expanding my skills and picking up on professional best practices
or data science related which aligns closely with my academic interests.

My long term career goal is to work full time as a software engineer, whether that be frontend, backend or data science related.

#### Education

I persued my undergraduate degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2023.
In my senoir year, I spent a semester abroad at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) where I took classes in the Computer Science and HCI departments.
For highlighted coursework, please see the [education section](/resume#education) of my resume.

TUM GPA: 2.3 (Passed with merit; 1.0 is best) <br/>
UCSD GPA: 3.945 (4.0 is best)

I am currently persuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder).
I am expected to graduate in 2025.

CU Boulder GPA: 4.0 (as of 08/2024)
