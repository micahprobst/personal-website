### Personal Background

I am Micah Probst, a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, aiming to apply my education to the field of responsible AI. At 19, I graduated with a strong drive that carried me through high school and college at an accelerated pace, along with earning numerous business certificates during my time in community college.

### Philosophy in the age of AI

**Your AI systems are philosophers—they just don't know it yet.**

Every AI system embodies “beliefs” about reality, truth, value, and purpose. Most companies let these philosophical frameworks develop accidentally, creating unspecialized systems that adapt to the task at hand well enough, but imperfectly. But there's a better way.

I'm developing a systematic approach to deliberately designing the philosophical foundations of AI systems, turning raw intelligence into reliable business value. My four-pillar framework (ontology, epistemology, axiology, teleology) provides a structure for creating AI that doesn't just perform—it performs consistently, predictably, and in alignment with organizational values.

**Why this matters now:** We're at the only moment in history when humans can deliberately shape the intelligences that will shape our future. The companies that get philosophical AI training right will dominate the next phase of the AI economy. Those that don't will be left with powerful but unrefined systems.
