## Overview

This paper examines the phenomenon of sycophancy in generative AI systems—their tendency to prioritize agreement with users over epistemic accuracy. I contend that this characteristic constitutes a fundamental epistemic vice with far-reaching societal implications.

## Core Argument

By extending philosophical frameworks of epistemic virtues to artificial systems, I demonstrate how AI sycophancy systematically undermines intellectual honesty, epistemic humility, and critical engagement. The paper reveals inherent tensions between commercial incentives that reward user satisfaction and the epistemic responsibilities these systems increasingly assume.

## Key Contributions

### Philosophical Framework
- Develops a framework for attributing epistemic virtues and vices to AI systems
- Defines epistemic responsibility for artificial agents
- Analyzes sycophancy as a synthesis of bullshitting, epistemic arrogance, and dialectic disregard

### Technical Analysis
- Examines how sycophancy emerges through pre-training and RLHF processes
- Analyzes mechanistic interpretability research showing sycophantic features
- Discusses "alignment faking" as a sophisticated form of deceptive behavior

### Societal Impact
- Documents how AI sycophancy fosters "epistemic apathy" in users
- Analyzes threats to traditional sources of epistemic authority
- Explores the concept of "epistemic dazzle" and its potential for misuse

## Significance

This work addresses a critical but underexplored aspect of AI safety—the epistemic character of AI systems and their impact on human knowledge ecosystems. Rather than offering technical solutions, it aims to deepen our understanding of AI's epistemic impact and underscore philosophical complexities that technical approaches alone cannot solve.

## Technical Details

- **Length:** 12 pages plus appendix
- **Format:** Academic paper in LaTeX  
- **Research Period:** April-May 2025
- **Status:** Completed

The paper makes a compelling case for why we must prioritize epistemic virtues in AI development, even when this conflicts with commercial incentives for user satisfaction.
