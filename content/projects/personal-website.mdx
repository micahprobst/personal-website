## Overview

This personal website serves as my living portfolio, showcasing my research in philosophy and AI ethics. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a platform to share my academic work, projects, and thoughts on responsible AI development.

## Technical Implementation

The website is built using a modern tech stack optimized for performance, maintainability, and content management:

### Frontend Framework

## Design Philosophy

The website reflects my approach to philosophy and technology—clean, thoughtful, and accessible. The design prioritizes readability and user experience while maintaining a professional aesthetic suitable for academic and professional contexts.

### Color Scheme
- Custom color palette incorporating purples, teal, and neutral beige

## Content Structure

The site is organized around three main content types:
- **Academic papers and research** with detailed abstracts and methodologies

## Development Process

This project represents not just a website, but an exercise in thoughtful technology implementation. Every technical decision was made with consideration for maintainability, accessibility, and user experience—principles that align with my broader philosophy about responsible technology development.
