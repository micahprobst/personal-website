**Special thanks to my friend [Julian Bouchard](https://github.com/JulianBouchard)** for creating the original website template and codebase that serves as the foundation for this site. The clean, modern design and technical architecture provided an excellent starting point for showcasing philosophy and AI ethics work.

While I've customized the content, styling, and functionality to reflect my own work and interests, the core structure and many design decisions originated from Julian's thoughtful implementation.
