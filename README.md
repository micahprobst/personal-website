# Personal Website

I created a personal website as an extention to my LinkedIn to showcase my projects, interests and skills.
The website is built using modern web development technologies and tools like Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS and Contentlayer.
It features a responsive design and a dynamic content management system that allows me to easily add and update projects.
Basis for the project comes from https://next-contentlayer.vercel.app.
