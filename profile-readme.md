## 💭 Philosophy Meets Code

I believe technology should be developed with deep consideration for human values and societal impact. My work combines rigorous philosophical analysis with hands-on technical implementation to help build AI systems that are not just capable, but genuinely beneficial for humanity.

**Always interested in discussing**: AI ethics, philosophy of mind, responsible technology development, effective altruism, and collaborative research opportunities.
